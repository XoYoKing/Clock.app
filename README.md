Clock
=====

I hate to have any clocks visible when I'm working, but after hiding all my clocks, sometimes I need to know quickly what time it is. I created this little app a few years ago to be opened quickly with QuickSilver/LaunchBar/Alfred to check the time. Finally got around to cleaning it up a bit and posting it.

You can get a prebuilt version from the Downloads. Universal binary 10.5 and later.
